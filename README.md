<h2>‚ú®A bit about me!‚ú®</h2>

üî≠ Current Project: I'm working on developing a dashboard that provides real-time news and weather updates. What makes it unique is the inclusion of a ChatGPT-generated summary, tailored specifically to your chosen city.

üëØ Collaboration: I'm on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on projects that focus on positive impact and community building. Additionally, I'm seeking a study buddy to explore data structures and algorithms together.

ü§î Seeking Help: I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skillset. If you know of any exceptional learning resources, especially in advanced topics, I'd love to hear your suggestions.

‚ö° Fun Facts: My skills on the paintball field might surprise you! I have a deep passion for animal care and welfare. A unique tidbit about my personal life - I met my husband through our mutual love for Magic: The Gathering.
